# tambola
Tambola is a game that is widely played across the world. To participate in a round, players
are given tickets (shown below) which have numbers on them. A round has multiple games
in it. A round is complete when all games are complete. As numbers are announced by a
dealer at random, players match the numbers with those on the ticket and cross them. If
they have crossed all numbers needed to win a game, they can claim to be the winner of the
game.
